    <p>hi, its crunchi.</p>
    <p>i'm been working solo on this website for 2 months now.</p>
    <p>i'm just gonna say, don't expect rapid updates like this for a while.</p>
    <p>most of the work that will be done this month is backend stuff and refactoring, so it'll be easier to continue on this project.</p>
    <p>have fun, and expect me to use this page as a blog of my dev process for a while, come and check now and again, maybe.</p>
    <p>thanks for reading this</p>
